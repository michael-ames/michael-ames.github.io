<p>The Sciencenter is a children’s museum operating in Ithaca, NY since 1983. The museum has only a small staff and few resources available for designing and evaluating new exhibits. The museum partnered with a local university to develop and test (low-fidelity) exhibit prototypes in the hopes of one day producing a traveling exhibit of its own.</p>
<p>Our task was to create an exhibit about <strong>sleep</strong> that would appeal to <strong>a wide age range</strong> and <strong>promote conversation and shared learning</strong>.</p>

<p>Our exhibit asked visitors to help put a friendly frog to sleep. Visitors could manipulate four settings in the room: <strong>temperature, light, sound, and use of electronic devices</strong>, and in the process learn about the importance of sleep hygiene.</p>

<p>Based on our initial observations, we made the following changes to the design before a second round of testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>supplemental activities exploring other facets of sleep (sleep needs across the lifespan; the physical and mental effects of poor sleep)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>new labels with prompts</p>

<li>
<p>timed-task for the main exhibit</p>

<p>We tested these new exhibits with children at the museum, and again at an after-school program.</p>

<h4 id="1-tactile-first">1. Tactile first</h4>
<p>Our initial design featured “dummy” controls for the environmental factors included in the exhibit: an adjustable thermometer, a quiet-loud slider, and an on/off wheel for use of e-devices. The large size of the controls made it easy for children to manipulate them, and their placement (low and in front of the exhibit) meant they were often the first component visitors interacted with. This “touch-first” quality drew in visitors and afforded an initial interaction that wasn’t facilitated/mediated by our team, which seemed to help younger/shyer visitors engage. Older children were also curious about the construction of the mechanisms themselves. hile this procedure was ultimately changed in favor of more direct visitor interaction with the bedroom environment (manipulating items in the diorama itself), we recommend including versions of these controls – gear-turning, dial-sliding, or similar – in subsequent iterations of the exhibit, especially if they can be made fully functional rather than mere visualizations of settings.</p>
<h4 id="2-benefits-and-perils-of-gamification">2. Benefits and perils of gamification</h4>
<p>Our observations revealed some critical tradeoffs resulting from the addition of a timing/gamified component. The challenge of working to beat the clock at both the diorama and visual search stations dramatically improved the exhibit’s appeal to older children (7+), increased dwell time and repeat play, encouraged onlookers, and fostered shared/team participation. These benefits lead us to suggest including a timed or competitive element in any future design.</p>

</p>
<figcaption class="image-caption"><br/>Some visitors felt judged by the digital scorecard<br/></figcaption>
<p>Yet the untimed, less structured earlier exhibit format allowed visitors to explore the miniature bedroom at their leisure and engage in narrative play (e.g. reading the frog a bedtime story), which seemed to be popular with younger children. We also observed more self-talk and verbal reasoning from children when timed/gamified components were absent.</p>
