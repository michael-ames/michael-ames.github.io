      <description>Instead I’ll want to make a layout section.html (with several partials, most likely) to display automatically. It’s not elegant, but probably the easiest way to do it is to make a layouts&amp;gt;section-name folder and put a section.html inside.
To make links work: always works: ../{category folder}/slug
works if in same folder: slug

      <description>An ordinary, totally normal paragraph. No strings attached, no promises attached. Just dull content. Trust me.
Another totally normal paragraph, but this time, it’s accompanied by a side note, sometimes also called boxout. This works well with CSS grid with the exception of side notes that take up more height than their related paragraph. Gotta try to avoid that. Another ordinary, totally normal paragraph. No strings attached, no promises attached. Just dull content.</description>
