		<p>As a design researcher, I&rsquo;ve helped media companies discover that mindless entertainment is <strong>anything but mindless</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shown clients in the tech sector how consumers expend effort to <strong>intensify</strong> and <strong>extend</strong> their own positive emotional experiences.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve helped clients working in healthcare, government, and education feel <strong>potent</strong>, not cowed, when faced with a mountain of data.</p>

    How I work

<p>I employ qualitative, ethnographic, usability, and design research methods in my work. I also draw heavily on my training in anthropology, psychology, and the study of emotions in product and experience design.</p>
