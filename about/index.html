<section class="about">
		<div class="about-text">
			<p>As a design researcher, I&rsquo;ve helped media companies discover that mindless entertainment is anything but mindless. I&rsquo;ve shown clients in the tech sector how skilled consumers can be in intensifying and extending their own positive emotional experiences. And I&rsquo;ve helped clients working in healthcare, government, and education feel potent, not cowed, when faced with a mountain of data.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-work">
    How I work
</h2>
<p>I employ qualitative, ethnographic, usability, and design research methods in my work. I also draw heavily on my training in anthropology, psychology, and the study of emotions in product design and experiences.</p>
<h2 id="who-ive-worked-with">
    Who Iâ€™ve worked with
</h2>
<p>Some of the clients I&rsquo;ve worked with as a sole researcher or part of a research team include: Hulu, Disney, Google, Humana, StoryCorps, and Hospicare, as well as multiple museums, libraries, local governments, and community organizations in the United States and Canada.</p>
<h2 id="past-lives">
    Past Lives
</h2>
<p>Prior to my work as a researcher, I spent many years designing programs, building strategic partnerships, and managing local and remote teams in the non-profit and public sectors.</p>
